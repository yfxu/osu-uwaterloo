Welcome to the official osu!uwaterloo club website! Blah blah blah a whole bunch of introductory stuff. Our club has no official meeting room, but that means that we're very flexible and free to roam around the campus.

## Club Meetings

Our club meets in-person roughly once every two weeks. Specific times and dates are subject to change due to the nature of student workloads and schedules.
