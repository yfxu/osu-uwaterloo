Welcome to the official **osu!uwaterloo** club website! The UW *osu!* club welcomes anyone interested in the game, regardless of their skill level, what modes they play, or however else they may choose to enjoy *osu!* (ahem* mappers). The club Discord is open to everyone, even if they are not a student attending the University of Waterloo.

osu!uwaterloo hosts a number of *osu!*-related events every term. This includes the trimesterly club tournament: Waterloo osu! Cup. Apart from that, there may be other special gameplay tournaments, trivia nights, *osu!* Skribbl.io, or whatever else the club members wish to organize. No term is the same, but you can always expect some fun events to be planned!

## Club Meetings

osu!uwaterloo meets in-person roughly once every two weeks. Specific times and dates are subject to change due to the nature of student life.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, club meetings were cancelled so as to protect the health of club members and other Waterloo students. In the event that another global health crisis emerges to once-more threaten societal stability, in-person meetings may be cancelled again.

## Collegiate Teams

Players who wish to compete at a competitive level are welcomed to try out for the osu!uwaterloo collegiate teams! While *osu!* does not have an officially-recognized collegiate esports league, some folks have been organizing a recurring tournament series dubbed the [*osu! Collegiate League*](https://discord.gg/V5XhAcj) which runs every fall and winter term. At the time of this writing, OCL hosts collegiate tournaments for both standard and mania. The osu!std league runs both a Tier 1 and Tier 2 tournament side-by-side, so players of all skill levels are encouraged to try out!
